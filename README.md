## Project features
I wanted to provide an overview of some key features I've incorporated into my website to enhance the user experience and promote transparency in our charitable donation platform:

- Donation Page with Confirmation Message: Users are directed to a donation page when they select a donation card. Upon submitting a donate price btn, they receive a confirmation message through Sweet Alert. This feature ensures a seamless and reassuring donation process.

- Local Storage for Donation Data: I save users' donation id to their local storage and display the donated data in the Donation page. This means users can easily access their donation history, even after closing their browser, fostering a sense of recognition and accountability.

- Data Filtering and Visualization: I provide a page where users can explore a history of donations, with JavaScript-based filtering and sorting for ease of use. Additionally, we've included a pie chart to visually represent the distribution of contributions across various categories, offering insight into the collective impact of our community.

These features aim to enhance user engagement and provide a holistic view of our charitable efforts.
